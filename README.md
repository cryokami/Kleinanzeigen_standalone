# Kleinanzeigen_standalone
A Webscraper used to scrape price information of certain products from ebay-kleinanzeigen to gain insights into average prices, price changes and developments.
Mostly for me to learn a bit more webscraping. 
IDEAS GOING FORWARD: 
Implement a docker compose for the SQL database (Postgres or MySQL most likely) 
Implement apache Airflow to time the scraping daily , alternatively use cronjobs. 
Add a Plotly dashboard (almost ready)
